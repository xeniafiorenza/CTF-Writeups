# CTF-Writeups
I'm a noob at CTFs but figured I'd do some write-ups for fun and to document my learning! :)

There are write-ups of the flags I've solved (admittedly not many) and personal reflections.

There are also write-ups of flags I only solved afterwards, for documentation purposes, but mostly for fun.

## CTFs
* Whitehacks 2021 [didn't do write-ups]
* [Cyberthon 2021](https://github.com/xeniafiorenza/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/Cyberthon-2021)
