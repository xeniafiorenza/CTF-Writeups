# CTF-Writeups
I'm a noob at CTFs but figured I'd do some write-ups for fun and to document my learning! :)

There are write-ups of the flags I've solved (not many tbh) and personal reflections.

There are also writeups of flags I got partway through solving and only got afterwards (with time & help), mainly for documentation purposes and fun. I'll only include the ones where I didn't refer to any proper solutions or other write-ups.

## CTFs
* Whitehacks 2021 - *(didn't do any write-ups)*
* [Cyberthon 2021](https://github.com/xeniafiorenza/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/Cyberthon-2021)
