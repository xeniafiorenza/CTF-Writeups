## Post-CTF Thoughts

This was a very welcome return to normalcy after the unconventional ~~trainwreck~~ CTFs that preceded it. This time, I suffered, *and I enjoyed it*.

The 0000h start time was disastrous for my sleep schedule, and my team's plans to meet up in real life were foiled by the rise in local Covid cases, but that didn't end up stopping me from having a very fulfilling and fun time.

Some fun highlights from the CTF:

This CTF had very few forensics flags (I miss vol.py) – and no OSINT flags at all – but this forced me to look at other categories and learn more. Hooray?

Every CTF I join makes me realise how much more I have yet to learn, and this was no exception. These 24 hours were an excellent learning experience; I tried quite a few new things, and got to apply some of the knowledge I've accumulated over my first few CTFs.

Many thanks to n0h4ts for organising STANDCON, and even greater thanks to my teammates, who are all far more competent than I am. Thanks for carry :)
