## Post-CTF Thoughts

Had a lot of fun in the 48h duration (and became spontaneously nocturnal in the process). I clearly still have a lot to learn, and this has motivated me to continue trying to improve my skills.

I particularly enjoyed the beginner-friendly flags -- As a relative noob myself, these challenges were very educational and I learnt a lot.

Many thanks to Social Engineering Experts for hosting this CTF!
