## Post-CTF Thoughts
My 2nd CTF ever :) Being inexperiened, and too swamped with the JC workload to properly self-learn, but mostly the former, I had no idea how to solve most of the flags, getting stuck on many of them part-way through. Still managed to solve 2 easy flags, though, so... could be worse ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Overall, I learnt a lot from this, and felt better-equipped to handle this than in the first CTF. I do want to practice more though, and go back to try some of the flags I didn't get at first, as well as read the write-ups from the actual big brain people. Maybe I'll grow a brain cell or two (generous estimate).

Many thanks to CSIT and Alt-Tab Labs for training us and creating a fruitful experience for everyone!
