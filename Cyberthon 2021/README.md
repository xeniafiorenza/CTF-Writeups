## Post-CTF Thoughts
My 2nd CTF ever! Joined as part of team Saltstorm (officially RI Group 5; we totally didn't forget to rename the team, haha what?)

Being inexperienced, and too swamped with the JC workload to properly self-learn, but mostly being inexperienced ~~and small brain~~, I had no idea how to solve most of the flags, getting stuck on many of them partway through. Still managed to solve 2 relatively easy flags, though, so... could be worse? Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Overall, I learnt a lot from this, and felt better-equipped to handle this than in the first CTF (RIP Whitehacks 2021). I do want to practice more though, and go back to try some of the flags I didn't get at first, as well as read the write-ups from the actual big brain people. Maybe I'll grow a brain cell or two (generous estimate).

Many thanks to CSIT and Alt-Tab Labs for training us and creating a fruitful experience for everyone!
