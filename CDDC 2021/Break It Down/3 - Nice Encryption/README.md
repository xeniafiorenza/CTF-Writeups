# Nice Encryption

## Challenge Description
We managed to steal an encrypted message from the GDC. The problem is, it is encrypted with some unknown encryption. Help us to find the secret message.

## Attached files
* decrypt_me_plz

---

## Solution
When opened in a text editor, the file seemed like gibberish. Looks like XOR to me!

To decode it, I used CyberChef to XOR brute force it:

Lo and behold... the flag.

P.S. After submitting, the hint was revealed:
> The first byte on the encrypted message is probably importantâ€¦

I'm honestly not sure what to do with this information, since the key wasn't the first character. Strange.

### Flag:
```
CDDC21{Wh0_wrot3_th!s_Thin6?}
```
