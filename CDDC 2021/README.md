## Post-CTF Thoughts

This CTF was hosted as part of DSTA's Brainhack 2021 series of events, right after Cyber Youth Singapore's [CYSummit CTF](https://github.com/xeniafiorenza/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/CYS%202021). It was a typical Jeopardy-style CTF but with no point decay.

The difficulty level was on the easier side - the pros on the Discord server were complaining about it being too easy and demanding a real challenge. As a noob I cannot relate to that, but I still found it surprisingly manageable.

During the competition there were several technical difficulties, which mostly affected the senior category. Despite this, I still enjoyed the experience of trying to solve the flags.
