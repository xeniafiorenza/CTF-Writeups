# Linux 3 &ndash; Historian

## Challenge Description

Some more intel has been recovered and it hints at new program developments the cyber bots system is running, the code is supposedly used to encrypt secrets.	

## Note

The Linux challenges are consecutive, starting from [part 1](../1%20-%20Lock%20and%20Key).

---

## Solution

First, we must log in to `bot3`, using the previous flag as the password, and then change directory to `bot3`'s home directory:

```sh
bot2@cybot01:~$ su bot3
Password: 
bot3@cybot01:/home/bot2$ cd ~
```

Let's see what files there are here:

```sh
bot3@cybot01:~$ ls -la
total 24
dr-xr-x---  2 root bot3 4096 Jun 18 09:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Jun 18 09:51 ..
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Jun 18 09:51 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-r--r-----  1 bot3 bot3  220 Feb 25  2020 .bash_logout
-r--r-----  1 bot3 bot3 3771 Feb 25  2020 .bashrc
-r--r-----  1 bot3 bot3  807 Feb 25  2020 .profile
-r--r-----  1 bot3 root  798 Jun 18 09:51 .viminfo
```

No flag file to be seen, and nothing too out of the ordinary. However, the `.viminfo` file looks promising.

```text
bot3@cybot01:~$ cat .viminfo 
# This viminfo file was generated by Vim 8.1.
# You may edit it if you're careful!

# Viminfo version

# Value of 'encoding' when this file was written

	*	1620820228	0
	"	1	15
	^	1	16
	.	1	16
	+	1	16
```

The `/usr/local/share/secret` looking mighty sus; let's check that out:

```text
bot3@cybot01:~$ cat /usr/local/share/secret
CDDC21{V1m_th3_s4vior}
```

Bingo. Vim the savior indeed.

### Flag

```text
CDDC21{V1m_th3_s4vior}
```
