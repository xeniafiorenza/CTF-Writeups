## Post-CTF Thoughts

This CTF had a pretty interesting format - there was no point decay, the flags were multi-part, the challenges were entirely on the web (using web labs with the required tools pre-installed), and the categories were also unconventional.

It was certainly not as challenging as other CTFs, but as a noob I appreciate not having my brain turned to mush on the first flag :P I still learnt a lot and had a fun time.

Many thanks to Cyber Youth Singapore and Pentester Academy for hosting this CTF!
