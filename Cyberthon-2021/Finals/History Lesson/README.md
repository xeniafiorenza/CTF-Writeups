## Challenge Description
Okay. I have both good news, and bad news. The bad news is that APOCALYPSE has deployed a mole to infiltrate our investigation team and he managed to send over one of our precious flags to them. However, the good news is that we've identified the mole, apprended him, and also obtained his browser history. Can you do some forensics and figure out what flag he leaked?
